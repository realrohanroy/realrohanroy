### 🙏 Namaste!
I'm **Rohan**, a fresher who enjoys building backend systems that actually make sense —  
not just projects that look good in screenshots.

I’m comfortable working **full stack when required**,  
but my **intentional focus** is on **backend engineering, APIs, and system fundamentals**.

I love meeting new people, discussing ideas, and learning how real software is built.

---

## 🧠 What I’m currently doing
- Building **production-style backend projects**
- Going deep into **Java + Spring Boot**
- Improving **API design, data modeling & architecture**
- Preparing for **Backend / SDE Intern / Entry-level roles**
